## Description

Basically a project based on a small portion of the "Undertale" game, so we decided to name it "OverFact"\
Also this project could be used as an example of how NOT to code in Verilog, since it introduces almost every type of bad practices.

## Learning materials

Actually where did I take some of the codes from, HUGE THANKS
